## Critters - a simple evolution sim
An in-progress evolution simulator heavily inspired by Biogenesis (https://github.com/sullerandras/biogenesis) - I wanted to have a crack at building something similar myself in C# before looking at it's source code.

The simulation is currently feature-sparse, just consisting of agents made up of various parts, who can reproduce and randomly mutate, changing those parts. There is also a crude day/night cycle and carbon system that can be visualised with the "1" key.
